      <p class="htmlcss">Hey friends! You might be wondering.. what’s the difference between HTML and CSS? How do they relate to each other? 
        Look at this text for example: “FERBY ROCKS!”. HTML is in charge of the text existing. We use html to create the actual content. CSS is responsible for the beautiful font! It is used to design and style your content. Together they are a truly beautiful team!

        <p class="loops1">Did did did did did did did did did you know that computers are really good at repetition? 
        </p>

        <p class="loops2">In Javascript loops are super useful if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value. 
            Let’s take painting you nails as an example. 
            </p>

        <p class="loops3">var nailsPainted; 
            for (nailsPainted = 0; nailsPainted <= 9; nailsPainted I++) { 
            alert(nailsPainted); }</p>

        <p class="loops4">What this is saying is, if you have painted less than or equal to 10 nails (reminder that in programming you start counting at 0) then alert how many nails that have been painted. 
        </p>

        <p class="dom">But what is the DOM? The DOM (Document Agent Model) is the glue that ties HTML, CSS and Javascript together. It is a document representation of your html. You can interact with the DOM to access and modify elements on your webpage. 
        </p>

        <p class="arrayobj">What’s the difference between an array and an object? An array is great to use when you have a list of objects! </p>
         
        <p class="arrayexample">var shoppingList = [ ‘apple’, ‘mango’, ‘beer’];
        </p>
      
        <p class="object">An object is one of the most used data types in Javascript. It is a collection of related data in the form of “key : value” pairs. These all relate to the overall object.  
            Heres me literally objectifying myself!
            </p>
      
        <p class="objectexample">var ferby = {
            hair: ‘curly’,
            job: ‘student’,
            age: 20
        };
        </p>

        <p class="function">A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. They are super useful because you can reuse your function to make coding a lot faster. For example here’s a function I made:</p>
        <p class="functionexample">function scream() {
            console.log(‘AAAA!!!!’);
            }</p>
