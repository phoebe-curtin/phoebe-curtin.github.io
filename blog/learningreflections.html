      <p class="questions">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?
      </p>
      <p class="answers">
        My long term goal is to get ridiculously rich and famous from a thing I do creatively. 
      </p>
      <p class="questions">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
      </p>
      <p class="answers">I have a tendency to completely back out of something and go the opposite way if something slightly isn’t working in my favour. I think EDA is going to improve my problem solving skills and get me out of that habit. </p>
      <p class="questions">A description of your own strengths and limitations.
      </p>
      <p class="answers">I think one of my strong points is being extremely easy going. I’m not the type of person who will send passive aggressive texts or are always involved in dramas. It’s not a huge accomplishment but it’s something that I’m really happy with. This goes hand in hand with my limitations too. I let people walk all over me to avoid any conflict. This is really apparent in group work, where I’ll choose to not say anything if I don’t like the idea and just do whatever I’m told to do to avoid upsetting anyone or making it awkward. Obviously I’m going to actively be working on all of these things.
