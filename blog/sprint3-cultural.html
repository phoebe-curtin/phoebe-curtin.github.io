        So for this sprint we focused on EQ vs IQ. I agree that our emotional intelligence is just as important (if not more) than our IQ. I think a really good tip for being a human is to be aware of your emotions and why you are feeling them. A lot of the time when we make our worst mistakes is when we immediately act off our emotions. Like when you feel entitled to yell at someone because you are angry, Or sending a stupid text. This is not me writing about how you should ignore what you are feeling. If instead of acting right away, you took an hour to breathe and think about what and why you are feeling the emotions you are, I can assure you will make a much better decision as you were going to moments before.
