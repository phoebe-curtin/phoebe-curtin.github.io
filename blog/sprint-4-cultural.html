      <h2>NEUROPLASTICITY AND HAVING A GROWTH MINDSET</h2>
      
      <a class="backsprint4" href="bloghome.html">BACK</a>
     
      <p class="neurotext">Neuroplasticity is the muscle building part of the brain; the things we do often we become better at, and what we don’t use fades away. It’s the idea that what we think we can become. As we get older we become fixed on the ways that we learn and think. Neuroplasticity proves that our brains are constantly changing, and is never in a fixed state. If you actively seek out something, your body will change with you. Personally, I engage in Neuroplasticity to improve my programming capabilities. To do that I practice programming most days, setting challenging (but achievable) mini objectives for myself. Staying inspired, and actively thinking about how I can improve is important.

      <p class="growthtext">Having a growth mindset is having the ability to let your mind expand, and to be open to growth and improvement in the brain. A Fixed mindset is when you don’t allow yourself to learn because of fixed beliefs. Anybody is capable of having a growth mindset, and it is very necessary if you want to improve on any skill. 
        I can get very upset like a baby every time I’m not good at something, but I’m actively trying to have a growth mindset  with programming to not let that happen.
